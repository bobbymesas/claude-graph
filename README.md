## Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bobbymesas/claude-graph.git
cd claude-graph
node build.js                  # compile content/nodes/*.md → data/nodes-compiled.js
python3 -m http.server 8000    # serve on localhost:8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`.

> **Note:** Must be served over HTTP — `app.js` uses ES module imports, which browsers block on `file://`.

After editing any `content/nodes/*.md` file, re-run `node build.js` before refreshing.
