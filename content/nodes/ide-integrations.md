Claude Code integrates directly into popular IDEs: VS Code via a marketplace extension, JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.), and more. IDE integrations bring Claude's capabilities into your editor — inline edits, context-aware suggestions, and terminal access without switching windows.

### EXAMPLE: Setting up Claude Code in your editor
### FILE: IDE setup
### LANG: bash

```bash
# VS Code — install from marketplace:
# Search "Claude Code" in Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
# Or via CLI:
code --install-extension anthropic.claude-code

# JetBrains — install from JetBrains Marketplace:
# Settings → Plugins → search "Claude Code"

# After installing, the claude terminal opens in
# your IDE's integrated terminal with full access
# to your project files and git context.
```
